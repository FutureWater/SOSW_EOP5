The Earth Observation Prototype 5 (EOP5) for Crop water productivity mapping is a prototype algorithm designed to estimate......

This repository is part of the Deliverable 3.2 of SOS-Water - Water Resources System Safe Operating Space in a Changing Climate and Society ([DOI:10.3030/101059264](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101059264)). Other code contributions to D3.2 can be found at the [SOS-Water - WP3 Earth Observation repository](https://github.com/mibrechb/SOSW_WP3).

## How to use

This folder contains all the necessary files and inputs to run pyWaPOR version 3.4.3 for the Jucar River Basin Pilot Case.
Steps to run the model: 

1. Create a new environment and install python (eg. *pywapor*) example in conda\
	*conda create --name pywapor python*
2. Install gdal=3.6 with conda\
	*conda install -c conda-forge gdal=3.6
3. Install the following packages\
	*conda install -c conda-forge pywapor=3.4.3 pyshp hvplot*
4. Create/Collect your EO accounts and password for the platforms below

5. Open config.cfg and fill accordingly (default values should work)
6. Open lulc_lut and change landuse parameters if needed
7. Files *custom_downloads.json* and *se_root_custom_config.json* include native sources from which download variables, change only if needed.
8. Open pywapor_v343 and uncomment *'Setup accounts'* section (or a subset of it, only the accounts that have been created in step 2). 
   When running these lines for the first time a popup will appear to request user and password for each account. 
   This only has to be done once, can be commented for further runs.
7. Run the file

Optional: 
   - For the extraction of spatially-aggregated values (.nc files and .xlsx tables) at the polygon level:
        . Run *pywapor_postprocessing.py* filling *shp_name* and *version* for your area of interest 
   - For the extraction of timeseries for specific sites:
        . Prepare a shapefile with the sites of interes (e.g. *area_valsites.shp*)
        . Run extract_tss4sites.py by filling demo_site parameter.
